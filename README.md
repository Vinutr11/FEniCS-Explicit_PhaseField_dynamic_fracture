# Phase field modelling of dynamic fracture and failure in fibre-reinforced composite lamina

Fracture remains a prominent concern in engineering, necessitating precise prediction and prevention of crack-induced failures. Leveraging advancements in computational power, computational modelling emerges as a pivotal tool for such endeavours, offering insights into fracture mechanisms inaccessible through conventional methods. While traditional sharp crack models face limitations in handling complex crack topologies, phase field modelling presents a diffuse alternative. Rooted in variational principles and extending Griffith's theory, phase field methods offer a versatile framework for simulating crack initiation, propagation, and branching. My Master's project at IIT Bombay provides a comprehensive exploration of phase-field modelling, elucidating its application in both quasi-static and dynamic fracture scenarios of brittle materials. Moreover, it extends this framework to predict crack propagation in fibre-reinforced composite laminates, introducing novel adaptations to account for material anisotropy and multiple failure modes. Numerical solutions to the coupled partial differential equations are obtained using staggered and Newmark explicit time schemes for quasi-static and dynamic fracture, respectively. Implementation is facilitated through the open-source software **FEniCS**, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility. Theoretical insights are complemented by computational validations against benchmark problems, affirming the efficacy of the phase field approach in capturing fracture phenomena."

This repository contains the codes, Mesh files and the results of dynamic fracture in brittle material and intralaminar failure in unilateral composite lamina using the phase field approach. Explicit time integration is used for solving time-dependent problem and a staggered approach is used to solve coupled PDEs. All the simulations are carried out using an open-source library **FEniCS** in Python.
