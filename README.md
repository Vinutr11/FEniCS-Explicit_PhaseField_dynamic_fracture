# Phase field modelling of dynamic fracture and failure in fibre-reinforced composite lamina

This repository contains the codes, Mesh files and the results of dynamic fracture in brittle material and intrlamina failure in composite lamina using phase field approch. Explicit time integration is used for solving time dependent problem and a staggered approach is used to solve coupled PDE's. All the simulations are carried out using an opensource library **FEniCS** in python.
